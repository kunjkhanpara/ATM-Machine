Project Overview
The ATM Machine Simulation is a console-based application developed using Java. This project simulates basic ATM functionalities such as withdrawing money, depositing money, and checking account balance. It serves as an excellent project for understanding basic Java programming concepts, control structures, user input handling, and date formatting.

Features
Withdraw Money: Allows the user to withdraw money from their account if sufficient balance is available.
Deposit Money: Enables the user to deposit money into their account.
Check Balance: Displays the current balance of the user's account.
Transaction Timestamp: Shows the date and time of each transaction.
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
A text editor or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans) to edit and run the Java code.
Conclusion
The ATM Machine Simulation project provides a practical example of implementing basic banking operations using Java. It covers essential programming concepts such as control flow, user input handling, and date/time formatting. This project serves as a foundational step for understanding more complex financial systems and software development practices.
